## The Problem
Air pollution is posing increasing risks on the health of the residents who live with it

## Our Questions
We were curious about many things, but mostly we wanted to discover which countries were the most in need of aid. This information would make it easier for countries sending humanitarian aid to concentrate their efforts and address hunger at it's roots. 
To try to find these locations, the main questions we asked were:
- Is there a correlation between Air Pollution and life expectancy?
- Can we measure the relationship between Air quality and life Expectancy?
- Is there a stronger relationship for certain pollutants and its effect on life expectancy?
## Our Data
We used data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) and (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset), with these two datasets, we cleaned and combined them to be in relation with one another. We used a dataset on the global air pollution to relate the AQI (Air Quality Index) to the life expectancy of countries.
## What We Found
We found that for AQI value and the PM2.5 value, the relationship was that the life expectancy goes down as they go up (*See Summary Page For More Information*)

We also found that the relationship between Ozone and life expectancy was opposite of the previous two mentioned. Where the Ozone value goes up, the life expectancy would also go up in value. We have to be cautious about drawing conclusions from the linear regressions because the multiple R-squared values are so low, meaning that there was a very weak correlation, and is hard to distinguish a pattern. This is most likely why we saw the unexpected relationship between Ozone, AQI value, PM2.5, and life expectancy (*See Summary Page For More Information*)
